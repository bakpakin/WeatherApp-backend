# JTC Cow Weather API

This REST API gets historical weather data for a given city.

## API

For current weather data, send a get request to /yourcity, and
the backend will send back a json file containing a lot of information with the current weather,
including temperatures, precipitation, and meta data. The data is from openweathermap.org.

The backend is written in node.js, and is simply a relay for transferring data from the
openweatherapp.org api.

Initially, we planned to grab historical weather for cities on demand, but money. :(

Here is a cow.
